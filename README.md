# Finance Dashboard

A local, private webapp to visualize my personal finances:  
- Monthly **income & expenses**  
- **Net worth** evolution  
- **Savings rate** and cumulative savings  
- **Portfolio allocation** by holdings and by categories  

Built with **React + Vite + Tailwind + Recharts**, data comes from my Excel workbooks and (optionally) a Google Sheets CSV.
